# Pool Notes

## Session Workflow
- Prep table.
- Prep body/mind.
- Sesh (practice/matches).

### Body Prep
- Warm up hands/arms/shoulders + light stretch.
- Warm up lower body + light stretch.

### Mind Prep
- Set expectations by acknowledging:
    * Calmonth, day count, total hours.
    * Day's accomplishments (win/meh/flub).
    * Any other personal feelings/logistics.
- Be calm, be curious, trust the process, keep it moving.
- You have time, take your time.
- You should be here right now.
- Get pool-ripped.



## Pro Player Observations
- 2023/02/20: Corey Deuel's hands [were shaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuCjdtKcvao) when he super elevates to cue at a cue ball frozen to the object ball.
- 2023/02/20: Corey Deuel [gets a ton of draw on the cue ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuCjdtKcvao) with very slow cue speed and pretty short stroke length.
- 2023/03/03: 2023 Predator World 10 Ball B-side round 1. Jun Kwon Ho misses routine but just slightly difficult 10 ball and hangs it in another pocket hill hill after brilliant run of entire rack to lose match and get eliminated. Packs up and leaves without a word.
- 2023/04/14: GM Hikaru says that securing alternative income stream (in form of streaming) improved his chess performance by eliminating the financial pressure to perform well. He's already earning income, so whatever happens at the match or tournament doesn't really matter, he just gets to enjoy the games.
- `2023/07/26` Max Eberle said he once went 5 years straight without missing a single day of practice.


### I Practiced Even When
- My left shoulder hurt terribly from overuse and not being strong/flexible enough to play pool after a 12 year break.
- My heart had been rebroken (moderately) by the same person who broke it the first time.


## Thoughts/Connections
- 2023/05/14: Pool is like fitness. You've not trained in 12 years, you're pool-fat. You can't be ripped today. But you can be ripped in a few years if you hit the pool-gym every day starting today.
- 2023/05/14: Pool is like lifting. You don't do exactly the same lifts every day, you shouldn't do exactly the same drills every day.
