# Pool Notes

## Pro Player Observations
- 2023/02/0: Corey Deuel's hands [were shaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuCjdtKcvao) when he super elevates to cue at a cue ball frozen to the object ball.
- 2023/02/20: Corey Deuel [gets a ton of draw on the cue ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuCjdtKcvao) with very slow cue speed and pretty short stroke length.
