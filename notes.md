## Pro Player Observations
- 2023/02/0: Corey Deuel's hands [were shaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuCjdtKcvao) when he super elevates to cue at a cue ball frozen to the object ball.
- 2023/02/20: Corey Deuel [gets a ton of draw on the cue ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuCjdtKcvao) with very slow cue speed and pretty short stroke length.
- 2023/03/03: 2023 Predator World 10 Ball B-side round 1. Jun Kwon Ho misses routine but just slightly difficult 10 ball and hangs it in another pocket hill hill after brilliant run of entire rack to lose match and get eliminated. Packs up and leaves without a word.
- 2023/04/14: GM Hikaru says that securing alternative income stream (in form of streaming) improved his chess performance by eliminating the financial pressure to perform well. He's already earning income, so whatever happens at the match or tournament doesn't really matter, he just gets to enjoy the games.
