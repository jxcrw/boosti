# Pool Notes

## Pro Player Observations
- 2023/02/0: Corey Deuel's hands [were shaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuCjdtKcvao) when he super elevates to cue at a cue ball frozen to the object ball.
- 2023/02/20: Corey Deuel [gets a ton of draw on the cue ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuCjdtKcvao) with very slow cue speed and pretty short stroke length.
- 2023/03/03: Jun Kwon Ho misses routine but slightly difficult 10 ball and hangs it in another pocket hill hill to lose match and get eliminated. Losers round 1 2023 predator world 10 ball.
- 2023/04/14: GM Hikaru says that securing alternative income stream (in form of streaming) improved his chess performance by eliminating the financial pressure to perform well. He's already earning income, so whatever happens at the match or tournament doesn't really matter.
